        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Stress is the response of the organism to any demand. Different individuals can show different stress responses to one and the same demand. Moreover, one individual can show a different stress response to one and the same demand in different situations / contexts. The stress response due to the demand depends for example on the coping strategies of the individual. </p>
        <p>With this research project we want to offer a method to track the individual stress and coping with a smart phone application. Using the website in conjunction with your phone you can systematically track these variations and find out how they are associated with your daily life. Your answers will also help us learn to more about the variation of stress and coping. </p>
        <p>With your participation you support our research project to better understand the fluctuations of stress and coping. </p>
        <h2>TrackYourStress cannot be used to treat stress </h2>
        <p>We would like to emphasize here that TrackYourStress is not a medical device. TrackYourStress is a good tool to measure your stress and to find out under which circumstances it goes up or down. </p>
        <p>A worsening of the stress cannot be expected. However, if you feel that your stress is worsening, we want you to stop using TrackYourStress immediately and please get in contact with your medical doctor or therapist. </p>
